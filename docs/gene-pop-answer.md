Perfect! Now I have all the information needed to provide a comprehensive explanation. Let me create a detailed explanation:

## **Your Project's GA Structure Explained**

### **1. Gene: `SessionGene`** üß¨
**Location:** sessiongene.py

A **gene** represents a **single course session** in your timetable. Think of it as one class meeting.

**Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class SessionGene:
    course_id: str          # Which course (e.g., "CS101")
    instructor_id: str      # Who teaches it (e.g., "INS_001")
    group_id: str          # Which student group (e.g., "GROUP_A")
    room_id: str           # Where it happens (e.g., "ROOM_301")
    quanta: List[int]      # When it happens (time slots, e.g., [0,1,2,3])
```

**Example:** A gene might encode: *"CS101 taught by Dr. Smith to Group A in Room 301 during quanta [0,1,2,3] (Monday 9:00-10:00)"*

---

### **2. Chromosome/Individual: `List[SessionGene]`** üß¨üß¨üß¨
**Location:** individual.py + DEAP creator registry

A **chromosome** (called **Individual** in DEAP) is a **complete timetable solution** - a list of all course sessions.

**Structure:**
```python
creator.Individual = list[SessionGene]
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Type:** Python list containing multiple `SessionGene` objects
- **Fitness:** `FitnessMulti` with weights `(-1.0, -0.01)` 
  - First objective: Hard constraint violations (weight -1.0)
  - Second objective: Soft constraint penalties (weight -0.01)
- **Creation:** Wrapped by `create_individual(gene_list)` function

**Example:** An individual might contain 50-200 genes representing all class sessions for the semester.

---

### **3. Population: `List[Individual]`** üë•
**Location:** population.py

A **population** is a collection of candidate solutions (individuals) that evolve together.

**Configuration (from ga_params.py):**
- **Size:** `POP_SIZE = 50` individuals
- **Generations:** `NGEN = 100` iterations
- **Crossover Rate:** `CXPB = 0.7` (70% chance)
- **Mutation Rate:** `MUTPB = 0.15` (15% chance)

**Initialization Strategy:**
Your project uses **course-group-aware population seeding** (`generate_course_group_aware_population`), which:
1. Extracts valid course-group enrollment pairs
2. Creates sessions respecting L-T-P components (Lecture-Tutorial-Practical)
3. Avoids initial conflicts by tracking instructor/group/room schedules
4. Results in 50 individuals, each with ~50-200 genes (varies by enrollment data)

---

### **4. Fitness Function** üìä
**Location:** evaluator

Each individual is evaluated on **two objectives** (NSGA-II multi-objective optimization):

**Hard Constraints (weight -1.0):**
- `no_group_overlap` - Groups can't be in two places at once
- `no_instructor_conflict` - Instructors can't teach simultaneously
- `instructor_not_qualified` - Instructors must be qualified for courses
- `room_type_mismatch` - Labs need lab rooms, lectures need classrooms
- `availability_violations` - Sessions must fit availability windows
- `incomplete_or_extra_sessions` - Correct number of sessions per course

**Soft Constraints (weight -0.01):**
- `group_gaps_penalty` - Minimize idle time between classes
- `instructor_gaps_penalty` - Compact instructor schedules
- `group_midday_break_violation` - Ensure lunch breaks
- `course_split_penalty` - Prefer contiguous course sessions
- `early_or_late_session_penalty` - Avoid inconvenient times

---

### **5. Genetic Operations** üîÑ

**Crossover (`crossover_uniform`):**
- Takes two parent individuals
- Swaps genes between them with 70% probability per gene
- Combines good features from both parents

**Mutation (`mutate_individual`):**
- Modifies individual genes with 15% probability
- Changes instructor, room, or time slots
- Context-aware to maintain feasibility

**Selection (`tools.selNSGA2`):**
- Uses NSGA-II algorithm for multi-objective optimization
- Maintains diversity through Pareto fronts
- Selects based on dominance and crowding distance

---

### **6. Evolution Flow** üîÅ

```
1. Load data (courses, groups, instructors, rooms) from data/*.json
2. Create initial population (50 individuals) with smart seeding
3. Evaluate fitness (hard + soft constraints)
4. For 100 generations:
   a. Select parents using NSGA-II
   b. Apply crossover (70% chance)
   c. Apply mutation (15% chance)
   d. Evaluate new offspring
   e. Combine parents + offspring
   f. Select best 50 for next generation
5. Export best solution to output/evaluation_<timestamp>/
```

---

### **7. Decoding** üì§
**Location:** individual_decoder.py

Before evaluation and export, chromosomes are **decoded** from compact `SessionGene` format to rich `CourseSession` objects:

```python
SessionGene ‚Üí CourseSession
(course_id, instructor_id, group_id, room_id, quanta)
‚Üì
(full Course object, full Instructor object, full Group object, 
 full Room object, time slots, room features)
```

This enriched format is used for:
- Constraint checking
- Calendar visualization
- JSON export
- Detailed reports

---

### **8. Time Representation: Quanta** ‚è∞
**Location:** `src/entities/quantum_time_system.py`

Time is discretized into **quanta** (15-minute blocks):
- 1 hour = 4 quanta
- Monday 9:00 AM = quantum 0, 1, 2, 3
- Each gene's `quanta` field contains sorted, unique integers
- Example: `[0, 1, 2, 3]` = Monday 9:00-10:00 AM

---

### **Summary Table**

| **Component** | **Type** | **Size** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Gene** | `SessionGene` | 1 session | Single class meeting |
| **Individual** | `List[SessionGene]` | 50-200 genes | Complete timetable |
| **Population** | `List[Individual]` | 50 individuals | Solution pool |
| **Generation** | N/A | 100 iterations | Evolution cycles |

Your GA evolves 50 complete timetables over 100 generations, optimizing for minimal constraint violations using NSGA-II multi-objective optimization! üéì
