# Root Cause Analysis: Room Type Mismatch Stagnation

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Statement

Room type mismatch violations stuck at ~150-167 across all generations, despite repair heuristics reporting thousands of fixes. The constraint wasn't improving even with only this single constraint enabled.

---

## Root Cause Discovery

### Investigation Steps

1. **Observed Symptoms**:
   - Violations: 167 → 160 → 157 → 155 → 154 → 152 (stagnated)
   - Repairs: 11872 fixes → 7746 fixes → continuing...
   - **Contradiction**: Repairs run but violations unchanged

2. **Data Inspection**:
   - `Rooms.json` has `"type": "Practical"` OR `"Lecture"`
   - `Rooms.json` has `"features": ["Fluid Engineering", ...]` (specific)
   - `Course.json` has `"PracticalRoomFeatures": ""` (generic)

3. **Encoder Analysis** (`src/encoder/input_encoder.py`):
   ```python
   # BUG: Used "features" array instead of "type" field
   room_features = [f.strip().lower() for f in item.get("features", [])]
   # Result: ["fluid engineering", "water supply", ...]
   
   # BUG: Created lists instead of simple strings
   required_room_features = ["lecture room"]  # Theory
   required_room_features = practical_features or ["lab"]  # Practical
   ```

4. **Constraint Check** (`src/constraints/hard.py`):
   ```python
   # Converted to sets and checked subset
   required_features = set(["lecture room"])  # {"lecture room"}
   room_features = set(["Fluid Engineering", "Water Supply"])
   
   if not required_features.issubset(room_features):  # FALSE!
       violations += 1
   ```
   **Result**: Almost EVERY session was a violation!

5. **Repair Logic** (`src/ga/operators/repair.py`):
   ```python
   # Tried string equality
   if room.room_features == "lab":  # Comparing "lab" to ["Fluid Engineering"]
       # Never matched!
   ```
   **Result**: Repairs couldn't find matching rooms → no fixes actually applied

### The Core Issue

**Data Type Mismatch Across Pipeline**:
- **Encoder**: Created incompatible data (specific features vs. generic types)
- **Constraint**: Expected generic types but got specific features → flagged everything
- **Repair**: Expected strings but got arrays → couldn't fix anything

---

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. Fixed Data Loading (`src/encoder/input_encoder.py`)

**`load_rooms()`**:
```python
# Use "type" field instead of "features" array
room_type = item.get("type", "Lecture").strip().lower()
# Result: "practical" or "lecture" (simple string)

rooms[room_id] = Room(..., room_features=room_type, ...)
```

**`load_courses()`**:
```python
# Use simple strings instead of lists
required_room_features="lecture"  # Theory
required_room_features="practical"  # Practical
```

#### 2. Rewrote Constraint (`src/constraints/hard.py`)

**New `room_type_mismatch()`**:
```python
def room_type_mismatch(sessions):
    violations = 0
    for session in sessions:
        required_str = session.required_room_features.lower().strip()
        room_str = session.room.room_features.lower().strip()
        
        if not _room_type_matches(required_str, room_str):
            violations += 1
    return violations
```

**Added `_room_type_matches()` with flexibility**:
- Exact match: `"lecture" == "lecture"` ✓
- Flexible: `"lecture"` accepts classroom/auditorium/seminar
- Flexible: `"practical"` accepts lab/laboratory/computer_lab

## Impact

### Before Fix
- **Violations**: ~160-167 (stuck, no improvement)
- **Repairs**: Reported thousands but none effective
- **Data**: Incompatible types throughout pipeline
- **Success Rate**: ~0% actual fixes

### After Fix
- **Data**: Consistent strings throughout
- **Constraint**: Matches repair logic exactly
- **Repairs**: Can find suitable rooms
- **Expected**: Violations should decrease each generation

---

## Validation

```bash
✓ Loaded 392 courses (all with "lecture" or "practical")
✓ Loaded 72 rooms (all with "lecture" or "practical")
✓ Test session: theory → lecture room → 0 violations ✓
✓ All imports successful
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/encoder/input_encoder.py` - Load simple strings from "type" field
2. `src/constraints/hard.py` - Rewrite constraint with flexible matching
3. `docs/BUGFIX_room_type_data_mismatch.md` - Detailed documentation
4. `test/test_room_type_fix.py` - Validation test

**Repair logic** (`src/ga/operators/repair.py`) and **population logic** (`src/ga/population.py`) were already correct from earlier enhancement.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run full GA** to confirm violations decrease
2. **Monitor progress** - should see improvements each generation
3. **Expect**: Room type mismatches → 0 or near-0 within 50-100 generations

---

## Key Takeaway

**Always ensure data consistency across the pipeline**:
- Data loading → Entities → Constraints → Repair
- All components must use the same data format
- Type mismatches cause silent failures (repairs report fixes but nothing changes)
