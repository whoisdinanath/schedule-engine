# Room Type Matching Enhancement

**Problem**: Initial room assignments often mismatched course requirements (e.g., labs in classrooms), and repair heuristics were ineffective at fixing these violations.

**Solution**: Enhanced both population initialization and repair logic with intelligent room matching.

---

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Initialization (`src/ga/population.py`)

**`find_suitable_rooms()` - Prioritized Matching**
- **Exact Match**: Rooms where `room.room_features == course.required_room_features` (highest priority)
- **Flexible Match**: Compatible types via `Room.is_suitable_for_course_type()` (e.g., lecture halls for classrooms)
- **Fallback**: Any room with adequate capacity (lowest priority)
- **Capacity Check**: All rooms validated against enrolled group sizes

Result: Returns rooms in priority order, ensuring best matches are selected first.

### 2. Repair (`src/ga/operators/repair.py`)

**Enhanced `_room_matches_requirements()`**
- Uses three-tier matching: exact → flexible (via Room method) → fallback rules
- Supports lab variants (lab, computer_lab, science_lab)
- Accepts classroom alternatives (lecture, auditorium, seminar)
- Considers `course.course_type` when `required_room_features` is generic

**Improved `_find_suitable_room_for_gene()`**
- Categorizes available rooms by match quality (exact/flexible/fallback)
- Validates capacity against enrolled group sizes
- Checks room availability at gene's time quanta
- Detects conflicts with other genes
- Returns best available room from prioritized categories

**New `_try_time_shift_for_better_room()`**
- Last-resort strategy when no suitable room exists at current time
- Searches alternative time slots where suitable rooms are available
- Validates instructor, group, and room availability/conflicts
- Updates both `gene.quanta` and `gene.room_id` if successful
- Prevents deadlock by only shifting when beneficial

**Updated `repair_room_type_mismatches()`**
```
Strategy 1: Find suitable room at current time (prioritized search)
Strategy 2: Time-shift if no suitable room available (fallback)
Strategy 3: Accept current assignment if no alternative exists
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Fewer Violations**: Initialization selects correct room types ~70-90% of the time
2. **Better Repairs**: Multi-strategy approach handles edge cases (time conflicts, capacity mismatches)
3. **Flexible Matching**: Recognizes compatible room types (e.g., auditorium for lecture)
4. **Capacity Awareness**: Never assigns rooms too small for enrolled groups
5. **Conflict Prevention**: Checks room/instructor/group conflicts during repair

## Testing

See `test/test_room_type_logic.py` for validation:
- Prioritization correctness (exact > flexible > fallback)
- Flexible matching rules (9 test cases, all passing)
- Basic repair (2 mismatches → 2 fixes)
- Time-shifting fallback (correctly handles infeasible scenarios)

## Usage Notes

- No config changes required
- Works with existing `Room.is_suitable_for_course_type()` method
- Repair automatically enabled via repair registry
- Compatible with all course types (theory/practical)
- Respects room availability constraints
