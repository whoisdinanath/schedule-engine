- ‚úÖ Room Conflict Violations (rooms double-booked)
- ‚úÖ Instructor Qualification Violations (unqualified teachers)
- ‚úÖ Room Type Mismatch Violations (wrong room features)
- ‚úÖ Availability Violations (instructor/room/group unavailable)
- ‚úÖ Schedule Completeness Violations (under/over-scheduled courses)

### 2. Report Format

**Output File:** `output/evaluation_<timestamp>/violation_report.txt`

**Features:**
- Human-readable plain text format
- 80-character width for easy reading
- Grouped by violation type
- Clear formatting with emojis (‚ö†Ô∏è) for visual scanning
- Total violation count at top

    - ENME 256 @ Seminar Room E-405 with Sajendra Man Bajracharya
```

### 3. Integration

**Workflow Integration:**
- Automatically called in `generate_reports()` 
- Runs after schedule generation completes
- Appears alongside other outputs (JSON, PDF, plots)

**Modified Files:**
- ‚úÖ `src/workflows/reporting.py` - Added violation report call
- ‚úÖ `src/workflows/standard_run.py` - Pass course_map to reporting

### 4. Test Suite

**Test Files:**
- `test/test_violation_report.py` - Standalone violation report test
- Tests all violation detection functions
- Generates sample report with random schedule

### 5. Documentation

**Documentation Files:**
- `docs/VIOLATION_REPORT_GENERATOR.md` - Complete feature documentation
- Explains all violation types with examples
- Usage instructions and implementation details

## üìä Sample Output Statistics

From test run (`evaluation_20251016_200233`):
```
Total Constraint Violations: 2413
- Group Overlap: 748 violations
- Instructor Conflicts: ~300 violations
- Room Conflicts: ~340 violations
- Qualification Issues: varies

4. **Manual Review**: Verify schedule before deployment
5. **Stakeholder Communication**: Share clear reports with administrators
6. **Optimization Guidance**: Identify which constraints need most attention

## üìù Usage

### Automatic (Standard Workflow)
```bash
python main.py
```
Report automatically generated in `output/evaluation_<timestamp>/violation_report.txt`

### Manual Testing
```bash
python test/test_violation_report.py
```
Creates report in `test_output/violation_report.txt`

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Formatting Functions
- `_format_group_violations()` - Format group conflicts
- `_format_instructor_violations()` - Format instructor conflicts
- `_format_room_violations()` - Format room conflicts
- etc.
