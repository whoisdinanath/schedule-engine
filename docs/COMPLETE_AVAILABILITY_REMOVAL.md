# Complete Removal of Availability System

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Both constraint and repair removed

---

## Summary

Successfully removed the entire availability enforcement system from the codebase, including both the hard constraint and the repair heuristic.

---

## What Was Removed

### 1. **Constraint (Already Removed)**
- ❌ `hc_availability_compliance` from `src/constraints/hard.py`
- ❌ Registry entry in `get_all_hard_constraints()`
- ❌ Config entry in `HARD_CONSTRAINTS_CONFIG`

### 2. **Repair Heuristic (Now Removed)**
- ❌ `repair_availability_violations()` function from `src/ga/operators/repair.py`
- ❌ Registry entry in `get_all_repair_heuristics()`
- ❌ Config entry in `REPAIR_HEURISTICS_CONFIG`
- ❌ Stats tracking in `ga_scheduler.py`
- ❌ Progress bar display (`avail:X`)

## Current Repair Heuristics (6 remaining)

| Priority | Heuristic | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | `repair_group_overlaps` | Fix group double-booking |
| 2 | `repair_room_conflicts` | Fix room double-booking |
| 3 | `repair_instructor_conflicts` | Fix instructor double-booking |
| 4 | `repair_instructor_qualifications` | Reassign unqualified instructors |
| 5 | `repair_room_type_mismatches` | Fix lab/lecture room mismatches |
| 6 | `repair_incomplete_or_extra_sessions` | Fix course quota violations |

---

## Important Change to `_find_available_slot()` Helper

The helper function is still used by other repairs, but availability checking was removed:

### **Before:**
```python
# Check instructor availability
if not all(q in instructor.available_quanta for q in candidate_quanta):
    continue

# Check room availability  
if not all(q in room.available_quanta for q in candidate_quanta):
    continue

# Check all groups' availability
all_groups_available = True
for group in groups:
    if not all(q in group.available_quanta for q in candidate_quanta):
        all_groups_available = False
        break
```

### **After:**
```python
# Only checks for conflicts with other genes
# NO availability checking
```

---

## Impact on System Behavior

### ✅ **What Still Works:**
- Group overlap detection and repair
- Room conflict detection and repair
- Instructor conflict detection and repair
- Instructor qualification validation
- Room type matching
- Session quota fulfillment

### ⚠️ **What No Longer Works:**
- **Availability enforcement is COMPLETELY DISABLED**
- Sessions CAN be scheduled during:
  - Instructor unavailable times
  - Room unavailable times  
  - Group unavailable times

---

## Why This Might Be Intentional

Possible reasons for removing availability:

1. **Simplified Testing**
   - Easier to debug without availability constraints
   - Faster convergence in test scenarios

2. **Data Quality Issues**
   - Availability data may be incorrect/incomplete
   - Better to ignore than enforce bad constraints

3. **Scheduling Philosophy Change**
   - Availability handled by human schedulers post-GA
   - GA focuses on hard physical constraints only

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Reduces search space
   - Speeds up repair operations

---

## Recommendations

### **If Availability Matters:**

You have several options to re-enable availability enforcement:

#### **Option 1: Re-enable as Soft Constraint**
Add to `src/constraints/soft.py`:
```python
def sc_availability_preference(sessions):
    """Penalize but don't prohibit availability violations."""
    violations = 0
    for session in sessions:
        # Check and count violations
    return violations
```

#### **Option 2: Enforce During Seeding/Mutation**
- Modify `src/ga/population.py` to only generate available times
- Modify `src/ga/operators/mutation.py` to only select available quanta
- **Advantage:** Guarantees compliance (no violations possible)

#### **Option 3: Add Back as Repair (Not Recommended)**
- Re-add `repair_availability_violations` function
- **Disadvantage:** Repair without constraint doesn't guide search

---

## Testing Recommendations

### **Verify New Behavior:**

1. **Run GA and check outputs:**
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Inspect schedules for availability violations:**
   - Check if sessions occur during defined unavailable times
   - Confirm this is expected behavior

3. **Monitor performance:**
   - Should be faster (fewer constraints/repairs)
   - May produce invalid schedules (need post-processing)

---

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to restore availability checking:

1. **Git revert** (if using version control):
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

2. **Manual restoration:**
   - Restore `repair_availability_violations()` to `repair.py`
   - Re-add to `repair_registry.py`
   - Re-add to `config/ga_params.py`
   - Re-add stats tracking in `ga_scheduler.py`

---

## Verification

✅ **All Changes Verified:**
- No syntax errors
- No lint errors
- No import errors
- All related references removed
- System compiles successfully

## Final Status

### ✅ **Availability System: COMPLETELY REMOVED**

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Constraint | ❌ Removed |
| Repair Heuristic | ❌ Removed |
| Configuration | ❌ Removed |
| Statistics | ❌ Removed |
| Documentation | ✅ Updated |

**System is now availability-agnostic. Sessions can be scheduled at any operating time, regardless of instructor/room/group availability data.**
