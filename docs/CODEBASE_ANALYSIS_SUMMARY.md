# Codebase Analysis Summary

**Analysis Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Codebase Size:** 36 Python files, ~165 KB  
**Architecture:** GA-based NSGA-II scheduler with quantum time system

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Your codebase is **functional but architecturally fragile**. The main issues are:

1. **Monolithic files** (`main.py` 342 lines, `population.py` 758 lines)
2. **Poor separation of concerns** (I/O, business logic, GA mechanics all mixed)
3. **No testing infrastructure** (0% coverage)
4. **Tight coupling** (changing one module risks breaking others)
5. **Weak abstractions** (context dicts, magic numbers, duplicate code)

**Good News:** Core algorithms work. Refactoring is low-risk.

**Bad News:** Adding features currently takes 3-5x longer than it should.

## 🎯 What You Should Do

### Immediate (TODAY - 4 hours):
Read and follow: **`QUICK_REFACTORING_GUIDE.md`**

Key actions:
1. Extract `ConflictTracker` class from `population.py`
2. Create `SchedulingContext` dataclass
3. Add input validation
4. Replace magic numbers with constants

- `main.py` reduced to 50 lines
- Basic test suite

### Long-term (5-6 weeks):
Follow full plan in: **`REFACTORING_ANALYSIS.md`**

Phases:
1. Extract entry points (Week 1) ← START HERE
2. Modularize population logic (Week 2)
3. Create service layer (Week 3)
4. Consolidate config (Week 4)
5. Add dependency injection (Week 5)

## 🔥 Top 5 Critical Issues

### 1. Giant `population.py` (758 lines)
**Impact:** Can't understand or modify safely  
**Fix:** Extract into `src/ga/seeding/` package  
**Effort:** 3-4 hours  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

### 2. Monolithic `main.py` (342 lines)
**Impact:** Can't test in isolation  
**Fix:** Extract `GAScheduler` + `standard_run` workflow  
**Effort:** 4-5 hours  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

### 3. No Input Validation
**Impact:** GA fails late with cryptic errors  
**Fix:** Add `input_validator.py`  
**Effort:** 1-2 hours  
**Priority:** HIGH

### 4. Context Dict Everywhere
**Impact:** Type errors, unclear dependencies  
**Fix:** Create `SchedulingContext` dataclass  
**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** HIGH

### 5. Zero Test Coverage
**Impact:** Can't refactor safely  
**Fix:** Add characterization + unit tests  
**Effort:** 3-4 hours  
**Priority:** HIGH

## 🛠️ Refactoring Approach

### Strategy: **Incremental Extraction**

1. **Keep system working** at every step
2. **Test after each change** (regression tests)
3. **Small PRs** (1 module per PR)
4. **Document as you go**

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid:

❌ Big-bang rewrite  
❌ Changing behavior during refactor  
❌ Skipping tests  
❌ Optimizing prematurely  

### Patterns to Follow:

✅ Extract method → Extract class  
✅ Wrap before replace  
✅ Red-Green-Refactor  
✅ Characterization tests first

## 📊 Current Architecture Problems

```
main.py (342 lines)
├── Loads data directly
├── Sets up GA toolbox
├── Runs evolution loop
├── Tracks metrics manually
├── Generates all plots
└── Exports results

src/ga/population.py (758 lines)
├── Generates population
├── Tracks conflicts
├── Allocates quanta
├── Creates genes
├── Validates structure
└── Helper utilities
```

**Problems:**
- Single Responsibility Principle violated
- Hard to test
- Duplicate code
- Unclear dependencies

---

## 🎯 Target Architecture

```
main.py (50 lines)
└── Calls workflow orchestrator

src/workflows/standard_run.py
├── Loads data (via DataService)
├── Creates GAScheduler
├── Runs evolution
└── Generates reports

src/core/ga_scheduler.py
├── Setup toolbox
├── Initialize population
├── Run evolution
└── Track metrics

src/ga/seeding/
├── CourseGroupSeeder
├── ConflictTracker
├── QuantaAllocator
└── SessionGeneFactory
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable components
- Reusable modules
- Easy to extend

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Characterization Tests
Capture current outputs before refactoring:
```python
def test_capture_baseline():
    result = run_ga_with_fixed_seed()
    save_output(result, "baseline.json")
```

### Phase 2: Regression Tests
Verify refactored code matches baseline:
```python
def test_refactor_matches_baseline():
    new_result = run_refactored_ga()
    baseline = load_output("baseline.json")
    assert_schedules_equal(new_result, baseline)
```

### Phase 3: Unit Tests
Test individual components:
```python
def test_conflict_tracker_detects_overlap():
    tracker = ConflictTracker()
    tracker.mark_used("instructor1", [1, 2, 3])
    assert tracker.is_conflicting("instructor1", [3, 4, 5])
```

### After Full Refactor (6 weeks):
- **Feature development:** 4-8 hours per feature
- **Bug fixes:** 1-2 hours to locate + fix
- **New developer onboarding:** 1 day

## 🚦 Decision Framework

### When to start refactoring?

**Start NOW if:**
- ✅ You're spending >30% time debugging
- ✅ Adding features takes days instead of hours
- ✅ Code reviews take >1 hour
- ✅ New bugs appear when fixing old bugs
- ✅ You fear making changes

**Delay if:**
- ❌ Tight deadline in <1 week
- ❌ Major features in flight
- ❌ No time to write tests
- ❌ Team not aligned on goals

### How to prioritize phases?

**High priority:**
1. Extract `GAScheduler` (enables testing)
2. Add input validation (prevents late failures)
3. Create `SchedulingContext` (type safety)

**Medium priority:**
4. Split `population.py` (maintainability)
5. Add service layer (loose coupling)

**Lower priority:**
6. Config consolidation (nice to have)
7. Dependency injection (advanced pattern)
