# Product Design Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive product design and system architecture documentation for transforming the Schedule Engine from a research project into a production-ready commercial product.

## üìö Documentation Structure

### Main Documents

1. **[Executive Summary](./EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)** ‚≠ê START HERE
   - Quick overview and key recommendations
   - 5-minute read for stakeholders
   - High-level decisions and rationale

2. **[Full System Design](./FULL_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md)**
   - Complete system architecture
   - Database design
   - MVP definition
   - Implementation roadmap
   - Cost analysis
   - Risk assessment

3. **[Database Schema](./DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql)**
   - Production-ready PostgreSQL schema
   - Indexes and triggers
   - Multi-tenancy support
   - Audit logging

## üéØ Quick Answers

### What database should we use?
**PostgreSQL (primary) + Redis (caching)**
- PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and complex queries
- Redis for caching and real-time updates
- See [Section 3](./FULL_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md#3-database-architecture) for details

### Should we build a web app or desktop app?
**Web Application (SaaS model)**
- Accessible from any device
- Easy updates and maintenance
- Better for collaboration
- Subscription revenue model
- See [Section 6.1](./FULL_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md#61-web-application-vs-desktop-application) for comparison

### What features should be in the MVP?
**Core MVP Features:**
1. User authentication (login/roles)
2. Data management (courses, instructors, rooms, groups)
3. Schedule generation (GA algorithm)
4. Schedule viewing (grid/calendar)
5. Basic reporting (violations, utilization)

See [Section 4](./FULL_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md#4-mvp-definition) for complete MVP definition

### How do we design the system for production?
**Microservices Architecture:**
- Frontend: React/Vue.js
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: PostgreSQL + Redis
- Queue: Celery for background jobs
- Deployment: Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)

See [Section 5](./FULL_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md#5-production-system-design) for detailed architecture

### What's the timeline and cost?
**Timeline:**
- MVP: 14 weeks (3.5 months)
- Launch: 20 weeks (5 months)

**Cost:**
- Development: $113K (small team) or $192K (full team)
- Infrastructure: $375-1,770/month (scale dependent)
- Break-even: Month 10-12

See [Section 10](./FULL_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md#10-implementation-roadmap) and [Section 11](./FULL_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md#11-cost-analysis)
