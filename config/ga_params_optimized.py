# Optimized GA Parameters for Multiprocessing

# RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION FOR MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE
# After fixing multiprocessing bug, these settings maximize CPU utilization

# Population size - INCREASED for better parallelization
# Small populations (10) waste parallel potential
# Larger populations (100) keep all cores busy
POP_SIZE = 100  # Changed from 10

# Number of generations - adjusted for larger population
# Larger populations converge faster, need fewer generations
NGEN = 100  # Changed from 50

# Crossover and mutation probabilities - unchanged
CXPB, MUTPB = 0.8, 0.3

# Parallelization Settings
USE_MULTIPROCESSING = True
NUM_WORKERS = None  # None = use all available CPU cores

# NOTES:
# - POP_SIZE=100 provides ~5-7Ã— speedup on 8-core CPU vs POP_SIZE=10
# - Total time may increase slightly due to more evaluations, but quality improves
# - For quick tests, use POP_SIZE=50, NGEN=50
# - For production, use POP_SIZE=200, NGEN=150 for best quality
